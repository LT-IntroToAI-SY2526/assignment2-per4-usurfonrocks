## Grading Notes

You'll be graded on your **pattern matching implementation** and **reflection on programming challenges**. I'm looking for:
- Correct implementation of the match function with proper logic
- Understanding of pattern matching concepts (`_` and `%` symbols)
- Thoughtful reflection on programming difficulties and real-world applications
- Evidence of testing and debugging your code

Remember: This assignment builds the foundation for our movie chatbot - focus on understanding **how pattern matching works** and **why it's useful** for natural language processing.

## Programming Implementation (7 points)

**Match Function Logic (4 points)**
- **4 points:** Complete implementation with correct while loop, all cases handled properly, proper use of indices and result list
- **3 points:** Most logic correct but missing 1-2 edge cases or minor implementation issues
- **2 points:** Basic structure in place but significant logic errors in pattern matching
- **1 point:** Attempted implementation but major flaws in approach
- **0 points:** Function not implemented or completely incorrect

**Test Cases Passing (3 points)**
- **3 points:** All 16 provided assert statements pass correctly
- **2 points:** 12-15 assert statements pass
- **1 point:** 8-11 assert statements pass  
- **0 points:** Fewer than 8 assert statements pass

## Reflection & Understanding (3 points)

**Programming Challenge Reflection (1.5 points)**
*Question: "What was difficult for you while completing the match function?"*
- **1.5 points:** Thoughtful reflection on specific challenges (e.g., handling `%` logic, edge cases, while loop conditions) with evidence of learning
- **1 point:** General reflection with some specific details about difficulties encountered
- **0.5 points:** Basic response acknowledging challenges but minimal detail
- **0 points:** No response

**Application Understanding (1.5 points)**
*Question: "Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database."*
- **1.5 points:** Clear explanation of practical applications with specific examples of query patterns and data extraction
- **1 point:** Good understanding shown with some examples of how pattern matching could work
- **0.5 points:** Basic understanding but limited or unclear examples
- **0 points:** No response
