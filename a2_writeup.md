# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part was trying to understand when pind and sind were supposed to change. Whenever they didn't match, it was a whole process for me to understand what I was supposed to and in which order i was supposed to implement the code. This was a learning experience though and I was able to understand after going over it with your code.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database possibly to match what the user input is to what information i have stored to output the correct information. If someone is looking for a specific piece of data from a move, I could match the words they use to the type of response they get. If they ask me for the rating of the movie, I find the words rating and movie and connect it with the information I have to give the right output.
